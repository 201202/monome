**Objective**: Build an uber kid-friendly monome (a complex electronic music instrument).
<hr>

**Arduino Uno**: code (simple and complete) for Arduinos that uses capacitive sensing to determine if monome keys are pressed.

**MaKey MaKey**: code (simple and complete) for the MaKey MaKey to build a touchscreen monome.

**Processing**: code that takes serial data sent from the Arduino/MaKey MaKey and creates a visualization of the monome as well as generates music.
